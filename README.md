Hangman
=======
*An app for playing hangman on an Android device*


**Features**

* The game starts immediately when Hangman is opened.
* Hangman picks a random word and displays the letters of this word as underscores. In this way the user can only see the amount of letters the word contains.
* The user can make a guess by entering a letter.
* If a non-alphabetical letter is entered or the input contains more than one character, Hangman ignores this input.
* When a wrong guess is made, a part of the gallows is added to the screen and the letter is added to a list of wrong guessed letters.
* If the gallows is fully built, the game is lost and the user gets informed.
* When the guess is correct, the letter replaces the underscore on all corresponding positions in the word.
* If all letters are successfully guessed, the game is won and the users gets informed.
* The user can choose the length of the word to be guessed.
* The user can choose the maximum number of allowed guesses.
